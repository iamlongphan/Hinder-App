Hinder-App
_________
An application created in Java that utilizes SQL / MySQL to showcase usage of relational databases, is presented as a text-based app rather than a full app with GUI.

NOTE: This app will not run on any non-local (any computer or laptop that is not mine) machine, however you can adjust the .properties file in order to make this work on a local machine assuming you have a local MySQL server up and running.
